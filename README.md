# LeetCode Problem Solving Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my **LeetCode Problem Solving Journey** repository! üåü This repo showcases my daily commitment to solving LeetCode problems, starting from today, and documenting my progress toward mastering data structures and algorithms. While I‚Äôve already solved **250 problems**, I‚Äôm now posting my solutions to GitHub to track my progress from **Day 1** onwards.

## üöÄ Starting Fresh with a Streak!
- **Streak Start Date:** October 5, 2024
- **Current Streak:** 5 days
- **Total Solved Problems:** 250+ problems (posting solutions from today)

### My Goals:
- **Daily Problem Solving:** I aim to solve at least **one problem per day** to maintain a streak.
- **Increasing Challenge:** Gradually increase the difficulty of problems solved from **easy** to **medium** and **hard**.
- **Consistency and Growth:** Focus on consistency while also revisiting challenging problems to enhance my problem-solving skills.
